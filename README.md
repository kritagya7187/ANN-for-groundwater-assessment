# ANN-for-groundwater-assessment
Groundwater Prediction using ANN 🌍💧
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (GWP.ipynb) that implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze groundwater-related data. The model is developed using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, with key steps including data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training.

🔹 Features:
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and standardization.
✅ Neural Network Model – Built with TensorFlow's Keras API.
✅ Performance Evaluation – Loss function analysis and accuracy assessment.

🔹 Requirements:
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the notebook:
